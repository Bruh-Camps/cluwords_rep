When the air enters the impellers axially and is discharged radially from the impeller, it is called a centrifugal or radial flow fan.t is the movement of air from one space to other as well as supply of fresh air into the air conditioned space.

As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.
